# Linked Lists

12/27/18 -- Code Challenge 6 with Jacob Anderson

## Challenge
### 12/21/18 Per canvas instructions:  

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

* This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.

* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

* Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

* At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

* Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

### 12/27/18 Per canvas instructions:  
* Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency

* Created Node class with constructor.
* Created LinkedList class with construction and insert, includes, append, insertBefore, insertAfter, and print methods.
* Added new nodes.
* Made three test assertions to test the LinkedList class and it's methods.
