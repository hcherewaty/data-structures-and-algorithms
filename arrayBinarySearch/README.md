Code Challenge 02 -- 01 12/18/18 -- Heather Cherewaty & Hannah Ingham

## Challenge
Per canvas instructions:  Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Collaborative effort whiteboarding with Hannah:
    - Identified problem domain
    - Visualized solution
    - Formulated an algorithm
    - Wrote code for the insertShiftArray function
    - Verification step
    - Tested code in console to be sure it worked
