1/8/19 -- Code Challenege 12 - Heather Cherewaty & Jared Pattison

## Challenge
### 1/8/19 Per canvas instructions:

dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.



## Approach & Efficiency 
* Examined problem domain
* Visualization
* Formulated algorithm
* Wrote AnimalShelter class, enqueue and dequeue methods
* Wrote checks for class and methods
* Identified Efficiency
* Wrote test assertions
