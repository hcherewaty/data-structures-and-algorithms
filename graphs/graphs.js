/*
little to no rules - everything can be a graph (kind of)
onyl 2 rules:
 Nodes :(  --> use vertex :) 

 2 ways to implement:  Adjacency, matrix

 Used in:  social media, maps (google, bing, etc), networks, natural language processing (Alexa: to associate words with what she thinks you said)

 Complete, Connected

 Adjanceny list:  hashmap + linked list

 Always given two nodes:  the start and end
 Looking for a path, you know you have seattle and ny, you're looking for how to get there

 algorithms to find best path:
  - Breadth first (most optimal if no weights)
  - Dijkstra's algorithm if you have weights in graph (will do a good job, but not optimal)
  - A* algorithm is t
