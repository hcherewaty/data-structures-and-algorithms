# Reverse an Array
<!-- Code Challenge -- 01 12/17/18 -- Heather Cherewaty & Jon DiQuattro -->

## Challenge
<!-- Per canvas instructions: Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order. -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- Collaborative effort whiteboarding with Jon DiQuattro:
    - Identified problem domain
    - Visualized solution
    - Formulated an algorithm/plan for the solution
    - Wrote code for the reverseArray function
    - Tested code in console to be sure it worked
